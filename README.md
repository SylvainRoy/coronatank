# Description

A two player tank game based on python3 / pygame.

Also, the outcome of being locked at home because of the coronavirus. :-)


# How to run it?

Ensure to have python (3.6 or above) and then install pygame:

    python3 -m pip install pygame

Then, to launch the game:

    python3 game.py

Press all the keys of your keyboard to figure out how to move, rotate,
rotate the turret, fire with the two tanks. (Enjoy!)


# What's next?

 * A server to allow people playing from different machines or locations.
 * A small AI to allow a single player mode.
 * Better weapons!
 * Sprites!
 * Sounds!

No commitment here. This is a toy project whose sole purpose is to be fun.
